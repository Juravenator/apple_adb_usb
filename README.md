# Apple Extended Keyboard ADB to USB converter

Done using the Teensy 2 and the wonderful folks at
https://github.com/tmk/tmk_keyboard

This repo is meant as a documentation of the process.
Some scripts `build_binary.sh` & `flash_teensie.sh` are provided that will
compile a binary and flash it to your teensy2, missing dependencies are
not automatically installed, but you get help getting them.
